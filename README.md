# Algorithms in Visual Basic for Applications

This repository includes the ".bas" implementations for Markov Chains that accompany the book entitled: <i>Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation</i>. These ".bas" files can be used in various VBA Excel applications. This repository also includes an EXCEL file that supports VBA. This file is called "MarkovChainsApp.xlsm" and incorporates all VB ".bas" files with some experimental approaches and textual explanations in regard to these algorithms.
