# Algorithms in Visual Basic for Applications

This repository includes the ".bas" implementations for Markov Chains that accompany the book entitled: <i>Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation</i>. These ".bas" implementations can be used in various VBA Excel applications. This repository also includes an EXCEL file that supports VBA. This file is called "" and incorporates all VB ".bas" files with experimental approach and textual explanations in regard to these algorithms.


Covering both the theory underlying the Markov model and an array of Markov chain implementations, within a common conceptual framework, Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation is a stimulating introduction to and a valuable reference for those wishing to deepen their understanding of this extremely valuable statistical tool.
